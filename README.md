TODO:
A LOT! But i will not continue on this project. The firebase realtime database is no longer up and running. This was a school exam, and i knew the sensors would focus more
on the implementation of diffrent taks given in the assigment than clean and modular code. This is reflected in this project. Still, im proud of what i maneged to put together
in two weeks with the knowledge i had at that current time. The project would look a lot different if i did it today.
